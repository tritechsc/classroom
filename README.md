# GitHub Classroom
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/education/classroom.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/education/classroom) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/education/classroom/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/education/classroom)

## The workflow you use as a developer, scaled for the needs of students. 

Developers rarely work all by themselves, on a deadline, or ship something they‚Äôll only use once (with no idea whether it actually works). 
 
Wouldn‚Äôt students be better served by showing versions of their work, iterating, checking in on milestones and showing off the final product? 
 
With GitHub Classroom you can set up the industry-standard workflow and free up your time to focus on teaching. 
 
*Classroom is a teacher-facing tool that uses the GitHub API to enable the GitHub workflow for education.* 
 
You create an Assignment with starter code and directions, send along one link, and students get their own ‚Äúsandbox‚Äù copy of the repo to get started.
 
Set due dates, track assignments in your teacher dashboard, or integrate other tools like testing frameworks. 
 
With Classroom, you can spin up your course on GitHub and move on to the good stuff.

## Why try Classroom?
 
*Spend more time with students, less on setup.* Students accept an assignment with one link, so you can get straight to the material. 
 
*Bootstrap group assignments in a snap.* Invite students to a shared repository, and cap the number of students per group. Use the same groups over and over again, or create new ones.
 
*More insight into student work than ever before.* See when students accept the assignment, and access their work from the moment they start. With version control, catch when they get stuck and help them rewind. 
 
*You are in control.* Students can work individually or in groups, in public or in private. Invite teaching assistants or graders to view the assignments. 
 
*Scales for large courses with ease.* If you have a small course, Classroom will make your life easier and save you time. If you have hundreds of students, we have you covered: as many repositories as you need, and webhooks to integrate automated testing tools. 
 
*Works with your Learning Management System (LMS).* Students submit a link to their assignment repository to your learning management system. Give feedback through comments in GitHub, but keep grades in your LMS.
 
*You‚Äôre not alone.* The experts on the GitHub Education team are here to answer any of your questions, and we‚Äôve got docs, best practices, and a strong community of educators to help you migrate to Classroom.
 
*Are you super-advanced?* Do you want to build your own tools? We üíñ contributions. Please check out [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Design principles

*Classroom is a teacher-facing tool to simplify the educational use of GitHub.* Every student needs feedback and support as they learn to code, and using GitHub you can give them the right advice, in the right place, at the right time. Classroom makes it easier to use the workflow you love, with some automation and ease for student use. 
 
*Students use GitHub. They don‚Äôt use Classroom.* Experience with real-world tools gives students a leg-up once they move on from school. Invest time in the tools students can grow with, not another third-party tool with its own learning curve. 
 
*Classroom is not an LMS (Learning Management System).* If you need to use an LMS like Canvas, Moodle or Blackboard, we hear you. Students can post their repositories to your LMS. We‚Äôre going to stick with what we‚Äôre good at, which is helping people collaborate on code. 
 
*Classroom is open source.* Git and GitHub are versatile with many ways to meet your learning goals, and we want to model the open source process that makes our communities great. 

We welcome contributions aligned with the roadmap below and through answering these questions: 
 
* Does it enable the real-life experience of using GitHub as a developer? 
* Does it replicate functionality that's best left to the expertise of content platforms, hardware or LMS? 
* How many support tickets and questions will the feature address? 
 
### Who is Classroom for?
Anyone teaching computer science in a high school, university or informal environment.
Folks who might also find Classroom useful:
* Higher ed statistics and data science teachers
* Higher ed biology and the hard sciences

## GitHub Classroom and the edtech ecosystem

In case you‚Äôre wondering ‚ÄúHow does Classroom interact with my favorite app/my notebook/my LMS‚Äù here‚Äôs the tl;dr on how those pieces fit together: 
 
*Apps and content platforms*

Examples: Codecademy, Skillshare, Udemy, Udacity

Apps offer premium content and interactive exercises. GitHub Classroom offers *real-world experience* with code. Classroom, as a teacher-facing application will eventually surface best-in-class content for top courses (notes / lectures / problem sets) but not produce original content. 
 
*Learning Management system/LMS*

Examples: Blackboard, Moodle, Canvas. Google Classroom

Teachers often use a learning management system in keeping with student privacy regulations. Classroom has a lightweight integration with LMS ecosystem--students can submit a link to their repositories. LTI compliance and Google Classroom integration will make the app more extensible. 
 
*Notebooks* 

Examples: BlueJ, Jupyter, RStudio

Most notebooks have a Git integration that students can push to. Future iterations may pre-populate repos with robust directions on set up.
 
*Hardware*

Examples: Chromebooks, Raspberry Pi, Lego

GitHub Classroom runs in Unix environments and Windows. Shared machines or lab environments are encouraged to use cloud-based environments, like Cloud 9. Integration looks like Git and GitHub pre-loaded + embedded in hardware. 
 
*Assessment*

Examples: Pearson, Travis CI, Circle CI

For GitHub Classroom, assessment is **directly related to the real-world experience of being a developer: your code passes tests**. Configuring folders in student repositories is a priority on the roadmap.

## The technical details
GitHub Classroom is a [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) application.

New to Ruby? No worries! You can follow these instructions to install a local server.

#### Installing a Local Server

First things first, you'll need to install Ruby 2.4.0. We recommend using the excellent [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv),
and [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build)

```bash
rbenv install 2.4.1
rbenv global 2.4.1
```

Next, you'll need to make sure that you have Nodejs, PostgreSQL, Redis, Memcached, and Elasticsearch installed. This can be done easily :
* For OSX using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) : You don't have to do anything! When you run `script/setup` later on this will be taken care of for you.
* For Linux : `apt-get install nodejs postgresql redis-server memcached`. For Elasticsearch, follow the instructions on [their website](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html).

You will want to set PostgreSQL to autostart at login via launchctl, if not already. See `brew info postgresql`. Redis and memcached may be setup similarly via launchctl or setup project wide by using foreman, described below.

Now, let's install the gems from the `Gemfile` ("Gems" are synonymous with libraries in other
languages).

```bash
gem install bundler && rbenv rehash
```

### Setup GitHub Classroom

If you are using Linux, configure PostgreSQL :

* Edit `/etc/postgresql/9.3/main/postgresql.conf` and uncomment `#unix_socket_permissions = 0777`
* Create a user and give him the rights to create a database : `su postgres -s /bin/bash -c "psql -c 'CREATE USER classroom_user; ALTER USER classroom_user CREATEDB'"` (Change `classroom_user` to the username that will run the classroom server)

Once bundler is installed (and PostgreSQL correctly configured for Linux users) go ahead and run the `setup` script :

```
script/setup
```

### Production environment variables
ENV Variable | Description |
:-------------------|:-----------------|
`AIRBRAKE_PROJECT_ID` | the ID for application in airbrake.io, if set Airbrake will be enabled
`AIRBRAKE_PROJECT_KEY` | the PROJECT_KEY in airbrake.io, if set Airbrake will be enabled
`CANONICAL_HOST` | the preferred hostname for the application, if set requests served on other hostnames will be redirected
`GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_TRACKING_ID` | identifier for Google Analytics in the format `UA-.*`
`PINGLISH_ENABLED` | Enable the `/_ping` endpoint with relevant health checks
`MOTD` | Show the message of the day banner at the top of the site

### Development environment variables
These values must be present in your `.env` file (created by `script/setup`).

ENV Variable | Description |
:-------------------|:-----------------|
`CLASSROOM_WEBHOOK_URL_PREFIX` | Ngrok url to receive webhooks (run `./script/ngrok`).
`GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`| the GitHub Application Client ID.
`GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`| the GitHub Application Client Secret.
`NON_STAFF_GITHUB_ADMIN_IDS` | GitHub `user_ids` of users to be granted staff level access.

To obtain your `GitHub Client ID/Secret` you need to [register a new OAuth application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).

After you register your OAuth application, you should fill in the homepage url with `http://localhost:5000` and the authorization url with `http://localhost:5000/auth/github/callback`.

To obtain your GitHub User ID for the `NON_STAFF_GITHUB_ADMIN_IDS` field, go to `https://api.github.com/users/your_username`

### Testing environment variables
If you want to make a functionality change to the application you will need to write tests to accompany that change. In order to do this, the test values in the .env file must be filled in.

GitHub Classroom uses [VCR](https://github.com/vcr/vcr) for recording and playing back API fixtures during test runs. These cassettes (fixtures) are part of the Git project in the `spec/support/cassettes` folder. If you're not recording new cassettes you can run the specs with existing cassettes with:

```bash
script/test
```

GitHub Classroom uses environmental variables for storing credentials used in testing, these values are located in your `.env` file (created by `script/setup`).
If you are recording new cassettes, you need to make sure all of these values are present.

ENV Variable | Description |
:-------------------|:-----------------|
`TEST_CLASSROOM_OWNER_GITHUB_ID` | The GitHub `user_id` of an organization admin.
`TEST_CLASSROOM_OWNER_GITHUB_TOKEN` | The [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens) for the classroom owner
`TEST_CLASSROOM_STUDENT_GITHUB_ID` | Test OAuth application client ID.
`TEST_CLASSROOM_STUDENT_GITHUB_TOKEN` | The [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens) for the student
`TEST_CLASSROOM_OWNER_ORGANIZATION_GITHUB_ID` | GitHub ID (preferably one created specifically for testing against).
`TEST_CLASSROOM_OWNER_ORGANIZATION_GITHUB_LOGIN` | GitHub login (preferably one created specifically for testing against).

To obtain these values you will need:

* A teacher (your primary GitHub account)
* A student (another Github account, created for this purpose)
* An organisation that the teacher is an owner of, but the student does not belong to.

It is best if you create your own organization for testing purposes, if you have done so:

To obtain the `OWNER_GITHUB_ID` value, you can go to `https://api.github.com/users/organization_owner_username`.

To obtain the `OWNER_GITHUB_TOKEN` value, you will need to generate a [personal access token](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens).

To get the `STUDENT_GITHUB_ID` value you will need to create another user account on GitHub and get the ID by going to `https://api.github.com/users/student_username`

To get the `STUDENT_GITHUB_TOKEN` value you will need to generate another [personal access token](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens) for the student account.

To obtain the `OWNER_ORGANIZATION_GITHUB_ID/LOGIN` you can go to `https://api.github.com/orgs/organization_name`.

Now you should have all of the values filled in, great job!

### Running the application

Foreman is setup to manage redis, memcached, sidekiq, and elasticsearch in development mode. Postgresql must be running prior executing foreman.

After that, you may start the rails server in a separate terminal with:

```bash
script/server
```

And another terminal with:

```bash
script/ngrok
```

That's it! You should have a working instance of GitHub Classroom located [here](http://localhost:5000)

## Deployment
